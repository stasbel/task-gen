Task generation problem as bachelor thesis

## Installation

I am using [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) as a primary tool for development.
See [environment.yml](environment.yml) for specification of python and 
dependency packages.  
Basically, to reproduce enviroment, you need to run 
`conda env create -f environment.yml`.

## Usage

### Hyperdash

In order for hyperdash to work, you will need to place your api key in `hd.json`
 file, like that:

```json
{"api_key": "<place your api key here>"}
```
